## Introduction

Apollo is packed with powerful modules and features designed for autonomous
driving development. Before you take it for a spin, please ensure your
environment is properly calibrated and configured by following the prerequisites
and installation instructions below. For a deeper dive, check out Apollo's
[architecture overview](http://apollo.auto/docs/architecture_overview.html) to
understand its core technologies and platform design.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Machine:** 8-core CPU, 8GB RAM minimum
- **GPU:** NVIDIA Turing GPU strongly recommended for acceleration
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

---

## Installation

> Detailed installation steps and scripts are provided for ease of setup.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Host Environment

Run the following scripts in order to prepare your host machine, which will
perform the following steps sequentially:

1. Install Docker (checks if already installed, then proceeds)
2. Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit (checks if already installed, depends on
   Docker)
3. Perform host system configurations

```bash
# setup host
bash docker/setup_host/setup_host.sh
```

### 2. Start Docker Container

Download and start the Apollo container image (only needs to be done once):

```bash
# docker pull & start testing
bash docker/scripts/dev_start.sh -d testing
```

Enter the running container environment in subsequent sessions with:

```bash
# docker into
bash docker/scripts/dev_into.sh
```

Setting Environment Variables

```bash
source cyber/setup.bash
```

### 3. Build Apollo

Build the entire Apollo project with:

```bash
./apollo.sh build
```

To build a single module, use:

```bash
./apollo.sh build <module_name>
# example:
./apollo.sh build planning
```
